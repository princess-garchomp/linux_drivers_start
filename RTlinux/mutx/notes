mutex_test_one
task one has is running continuously for 5 seconds, is incramenting a counter and has lower pririty then task two.
task two sets the counter to zero every 1 second. 
the higher priority task is changing the shared variable.

the counter will never get over the value 4000000 becuase of it is being reset to zero every 1 second

mutex_test_two
once the second task sets the value counter to zero, task one stops incramenting its value

mutex_test_three
task one will not ever rech counter value 4000000, meaning it will only stop running after teh 5 second deadline and not before.



this illistrates why we need to lock variables via mutex,
