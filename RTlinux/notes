I changed the kernel of one of my devices to include the PREEMPT_RT patch
  (I used the follwing website as a guide: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51669724/install-rt-linux-patch-for-ubuntu)

kernel info device A: Linux ... 5.4.5-rt3 ...
kernel info devoce B: Linux ... 5.4.0-53-generic ...

I initally thought there was a new API to use the RTlinux premption, this is wrong. both kernela (with and without the patch) do multithreading the same way.
the differnece is taht the PREEMPT_RT kernel has had things changed so that the OS can act more deterministically.

I wanted to show that there was a differnece between the kernels, so I used rt-tests on both.
  (sudo apt install rt-tests)

NOTE: device A and device B are differnet hardware platforms, both PC class computers, the diffence in test results may be partly due to that.
for my purposes, this does not matter at the moment.

sudo cyclictest --smp -p95 -m
